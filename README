Description:

  Backward compatible pbkdf2_hmac() in python.

  Compatible with python 2 and 3.

  This was coded in 2014 when hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac() didn't exist yet.

  After hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac() was new in Python version 2.7.8 and 3.4 the API of
  pbkdf2_hmac() was made equal to hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac(), except the type of the
  first parameter.
